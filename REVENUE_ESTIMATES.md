## 🎯 Quick Revenue Calculator

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Revenue = (Monthly Visitors × Page Views per Visitor × CPM) / 1000

Example:
- 10,000 visitors/month
- 2 page views per visitor = 20,000 page views
- $3 CPM
- Revenue = (20,000 × $3) / 1000 = $60/month
```

**With 3 Ad Placements:**
```
Revenue = (Page Views × CPM × Number of Ad Units) / 1000

Same example with 3 ads:
- Revenue = (20,000 × $3 × 3) / 1000 = $180/month
```

*Note: Ad networks typically limit how many ads can be monetized per page. Check your ad network's policies.*
